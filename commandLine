  Most commonly used characer classes.
    [:alnum:] Any alphanumeric character
    [:alpha:] Any alphabetic character
    [:digit:] Any numeral
    [:lower:] Any lowercase letter
    [:upper:] Any uppercase letter

    Examples:
    [abc]*		    Any file beginning with either a, b, or c
    backup.[0-9][0-9][0-9]  Any file beginning with backup. followed by
			    exactly three numerals
    [[:upper:]]*	    Any file beginning with an uppercase letter
    [![:digit:]]*	    Any file not beginning with a numeral
    *[[:lower:]123]	    Any file ending with a lowercase letter or the
			    numerals 1, 2, or 3
  Character ranges: if you are coming from another Unix-like environment
  or have been reading some other books on this subject, you may have
  encountered the [A-Z] or the [a-z] character range notations. These are
  traditional Unix notations and worked in older versions of Linux as well.
  They can still work, but you have to be very careful with them because
  they will not produce the expected results unless properly configured.
  For now, you should avoid using them and use character classes instead.
