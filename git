# Git

## Rules for the patterns you can put in .gitignore
   · Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
   · Standard glob patterns work.
   · You can start patterns with a forward slash ( / ) to avoid recursivity.
   · You can end patterns with a forward slash ( / ) to specify a directory.
   · You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point ( ! ).
   · You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z
     would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z.
